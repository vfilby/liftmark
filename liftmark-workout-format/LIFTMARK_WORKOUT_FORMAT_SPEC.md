## Overview

The LiftMark Workout Format (LMWF) is a markdown-based format designed for easy workout creation and import. It's optimized to be:

- **LLM-Friendly**: Simple structure that AI assistants can easily generate
- **Human-Readable**: Clear syntax that humans can write and edit
- **Flexible**: Supports simple to advanced workout tracking
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new features without breaking existing workouts

## Basic Structure

Every workout follows this hierarchical structure:

```
# [Workout Name]
[Optional freeform notes/description]

## [Exercise Name]
[Optional freeform notes]
- [Set 1]
- [Set 2]
- [Set N]

## [Next Exercise]
...
```

**Key Principles:**
- **One Workout Per File**: Each markdown file contains a single workout
- **Flexible Headers**: Workout can be any header level (H1-H6), exercise must be one level below
- **Freeform Notes**: Any text between headers is treated as notes
- **Minimal Metadata**: No required `@` metadata, keep it simple
- **Name = Header**: The header text is the name (no "Workout:" prefix needed)

---

## Workout Header

### Required
- Any header level (H1-H6) - The header text is the workout name

### Optional Metadata
- `@tags: [tag1, tag2, ...]` - Comma-separated tags for organization
- `@units: [lbs|kg]` - Default weight unit for this workout (if not specified on individual sets)
- **Freeform notes**: Any text after the header (before first exercise) is treated as workout notes

### Examples

**Minimal:**
```markdown
# Push Day
```

**With freeform notes:**
```markdown
# Push Day A

Feeling strong today, going for PRs on bench.
Sleep was good, nutrition on point.

## Bench Press
- 225 x 5
```

**With tags:**
```markdown
# Push Day A
@tags: push, strength, upper

Ready to hit some PRs today!

## Bench Press
- 225 x 5
```

**With default units:**
```markdown
# Push Day
@units: kg

Prefer using kilograms - easier for tracking.

## Bench Press
- 100 x 5
- 110 x 5
- 120 kg x 3
- 225 lbs x 1

## Overhead Press
- 50 x 8
- 55 x 8
```

**Flexible header levels for document organization:**
```markdown
# My Training Log

Weekly notes: Focusing on progressive overload this month.

## Week 1 - Day 1: Push
@tags: push

Great session, felt strong.

### Bench Press
- 225 x 5
- 245 x 3

### Overhead Press
- 135 x 8
```

Note: The workout is "Week 1 - Day 1: Push" (the first header with exercises). Headers above it are for document organization.

---

## Exercise Blocks

### Required
- Header one level below workout header - The header text is the exercise name

### Optional Metadata
- `@type: [equipment]` - Freeform equipment type (e.g., `barbell`, `dumbbell`, `cable`, `resistance band`, `kettlebell`) - completely optional
- **Freeform notes**: Any text after the exercise header (before first set) is treated as exercise notes

### Examples

**Simple exercise:**
```markdown
## Bench Press
- 135 x 5
- 185 x 5
- 225 x 5
```

**With freeform notes:**
```markdown
# Push Day

## Bench Press

Retract scapula, touch chest on every rep.
Focus on driving through the floor.

- 135 lbs x 5 reps
- 185 lbs x 5 reps
- 225 lbs x 5 reps
```

**With optional type:**
```markdown
# Workout

- 30 lbs x 12
- 30 lbs x 10

### Tricep Extension

- 20 lbs x 12

### Face Pull
- 40 lbs x 15
- 40 lbs x 15
```

---

## Set Format

### Basic Syntax

```
- [weight] [unit] x [reps] [reps_unit] [@modifiers]
```

### Components

1. **Weight** (optional for bodyweight):
   - Number (integer or decimal)
   - Can be omitted for bodyweight exercises

2. **Weight Unit**:
   - `lbs` - Pounds
   - `kg` - Kilograms
   - `bw` - Bodyweight (can be omitted if no weight specified)

3. **Reps** (optional for time-based):
   - Number (integer)
   - `AMRAP` - As Many Reps As Possible
   - Can be omitted for time-based exercises

4. **Time/Rep Unit** (optional):
   - `reps` - Repetitions (default, can be omitted)
   - `s` or `sec` - Seconds (for time-based exercises)
   - `m` or `min` - Minutes (for time-based exercises)

### Flexible Formats

All of these are valid:

```markdown
# Minimal (assumes reps, no unit)
- 225 x 5

# Explicit
- 225 lbs x 5 reps

# Kilograms
- 100 kg x 5 reps

# Bodyweight
- bw x 10
- x 10          # Bodyweight implied
- 10            # Single number = bodyweight reps

# Time-based (duration exercises)
- 60s           # 60 seconds (plank, hold)
- 2m            # 2 minutes
- 90 sec        # 90 seconds

# Time-based with weight
- 45 lbs x 60s  # Weighted plank with 45lb plate for 60 seconds
- 100 kg x 30s  # Weighted holds
- 25 lbs for 45s # Alternative "for" syntax

# AMRAP
- 135 x AMRAP
- bw x AMRAP
```

---

## Modifiers

Modifiers provide functional metadata that affects how the app behaves. They use `@key: value` format at the end of the set line.

**Design Philosophy**: Only include modifiers that change app behavior. Descriptive information (tempo, effort level, etc.) should be written as freeform notes since the app displays them anyway.

### Available Modifiers

| Modifier | Values | Description | Example |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `@rest` | Number + `s`/`m` | Rest timer after set (triggers countdown in app) | `@rest: 180s` or `@rest: 3m` |
| `@dropset` | flag | Drop set indicator (changes UI tracking) | `@dropset` |
| `@perside` | flag | Per-side indicator (shows dual sequential timers for timed sets) | `@perside` |

### Examples

```markdown
# Rest periods (triggers timer in app)
- 315 lbs x 3 reps @rest: 3m
- 315 lbs x 3 reps @rest: 180s

# Drop set (UI shows connected sets)
- 100 lbs x 12 reps
- 70 lbs x 10 reps @dropset
- 50 lbs x 8 reps @dropset

# Per-side (explicit modifier)
- 30s @perside
- 45s @perside

# Per-side (auto-detected from exercise notes)
# Recognized keywords: per side, per leg, per arm, each side, each leg, each arm, each
## Side Plank
per side
- 60s
- 45s

## Single Leg RDL Hold
each leg
- 30s
- 30s

# Per-side (auto-detected from set-line trailing text)
# Same keywords recognized inline on the set line itself
## Standing Quad Stretch
Pull heel to glutes, keep knees together
- 60s per leg

## Pigeon Pose
- 90s per side

# Multiple modifiers
- 225 lbs x 5 reps @rest: 180s

# AMRAP (to failure implied)
- 135 lbs x AMRAP
- bw x AMRAP
```

### Descriptive Information (Use Freeform Notes)

For tempo, RPE, and other descriptive data, use freeform notes:

# Empty Workout
@tags: test

Some notes but no exercises.
```
❌ No workout header found. Must have a header (# Workout Name) with exercises below it.

**Invalid - No sets:**
```markdown
# Workout: Test
## Bench Press
```
❌ No workout header found. Must have a header (# Workout Name) with exercises below it.

**Invalid - Negative weight:**
```markdown
# Workout: Test

# Workout: Test
@units: pounds

## Bench Press
- 225 x 5
```
❌ Line 2: Invalid @units value "pounds". Must be "lbs" or "kg"

---

## Edge Cases

### Handling Ambiguity

**Case 1: Single number - is it reps or weight?**
```markdown
- 10
```
**Interpretation:** 10 bodyweight reps (weight requires unit)

**Case 2: Number with unit only**
```markdown
- 135 lbs
```
**Interpretation:** Invalid - must have reps or time

**Case 3: Mixed units in same exercise**
```markdown
## Dumbbell Press
- 50 lbs x 10
- 25 kg x 8
```
**Interpretation:** Valid - parser respects per-set units

**Case 4: Extra whitespace**
```markdown
## Squat
-    225   lbs  x   5   reps   @rpe:  8
```
**Interpretation:** Valid - parser is whitespace-tolerant

**Case 5: Bodyweight meaning - Does weight include user's bodyweight?**
```markdown
## Squat
- 225 lbs x 5     # 225 lbs barbell, bodyweight not counted

## Pull-up
- 10              # Bodyweight only
- 25 lbs x 8      # Bodyweight + 25lb weight belt

## Plank
- 60s             # Bodyweight only
- 45 lbs x 45s    # Bodyweight + 45lb plate on back
```
**Interpretation:** Weight always represents **external/additional resistance only**. User's bodyweight is never included in the weight number. This convention works for all exercises:
- **Barbell exercises** (Squat, Bench, Deadlift): Weight = bar + plates
- **Bodyweight + load** (Pull-up, Dip, Plank): Weight = additional resistance
- **Bodyweight only**: No weight specified, or weight = 0

**Why this works:** For progress tracking, we only care about changes in external load over time, not absolute total load. Consistency within an exercise is what matters.

**Case 6: Markdown formatting in notes**
```markdown
# Workout: Test
@notes: This is **bold** and *italic*

## Squat
@notes: Focus on *depth* and **power**
- 225 x 5
```
**Interpretation:** Valid - preserve markdown in notes for display

**Case 7: Special characters in names**
```markdown
## Barbell Back Squat (Low Bar)
- 315 x 5

## DB Bench Press - 30° Incline
- 80 x 10
```
**Interpretation:** Valid - allow special characters in names

## Parsing Strategy

### Parser Behavior

1. **Case Insensitive Units**: `LBS`, `lbs`, `Lbs` all valid
2. **Whitespace Tolerant**: Multiple spaces, tabs handled
3. **Line Endings**: Support CRLF, LF, CR
4. **UTF-8 Encoding**: Support international characters
5. **Partial Parse**: Continue parsing after non-critical errors
6. **Error Recovery**: Provide helpful error messages with line numbers

### Parsing Steps

1. **Split into lines** and normalize line endings
2. **Identify workout header**:
   - Find the first header that has child headers containing list items (sets)
   - That's the workout (one workout per file)
3. **Extract workout metadata**:
   - Lines starting with `@` immediately after header
   - All other text until next header = freeform notes
4. **Identify exercises** (headers one level below workout):
   - Must have at least one set (list item with `-`)
5. **For each exercise**:
   - Extract `@` metadata lines
   - Collect freeform notes (text before first set)
   - Parse sets (lines starting with `-`)
6. **Validate structure** against rules
7. **Return parse result** with data + errors/warnings

### Header Level Detection

**Strategy**: One workout per file with flexible header levels for document organization

**Simple Rule**: First header (any level H1-H6) = workout name, next level down = exercises

```markdown
# My Training Notes         ← Document organization (ignored)

Notes about my training program and goals.

## Push Day                 ← WORKOUT (first header with exercises)
@tags: strength, push

### Bench Press             ← Exercise (one level below workout)
- 225 x 5

### Overhead Press          ← Exercise
- 135 x 8
```

Or with deeper nesting:

```markdown
# 2026 Training Log         ← Document organization

## January                  ← Document organization

### Week 1                  ← Document organization

#### Push Day A             ← WORKOUT (first header with exercises)

##### Bench Press           ← Exercise (one level below workout)
- 225 x 5
```

**Detection Logic**:
1. Find the first header that has child headers containing list items (sets) - that's the workout
2. All headers one level below the workout header = exercises
3. Headers containing "superset" (case-insensitive) with child exercises = superset grouping
   - Child exercises can be at ANY header level below the superset (not limited to parent+1)
   - Example: H2 superset can have H3, H4, or H5 exercises
4. Other nested headers under exercises = section grouping (warmup, cooldown, etc.)

**Superset vs Section Grouping Example**:
```markdown
### Push Day              ← Workout (has exercises below)

#### Warmup               ← Section (no "superset" in name)
##### Arm Circles         ← Exercise (warmup exercise)
- 10

#### Bench Press          ← Exercise (main work)
- 225 x 5

#### Superset: Chest      ← Superset (contains "superset")
##### Cable Fly           ← Exercise (part of superset)
- 30 x 15

##### Pullover            ← Exercise (part of superset)
- 50 x 15

#### Cooldown             ← Section (no "superset" in name)
##### Stretching          ← Exercise (cooldown)
- 60s
```

**Key Rules**:
- If header name contains "superset" (case-insensitive), it's a superset. Otherwise, it's a section grouping.
- Superset exercises can be at ANY header level below the superset header (not limited to parent+1)
  - Valid: H2 Superset → H4 Exercises (skipping H3)
  - Valid: H1 Superset → H3 Exercises (skipping H2)
  - Valid: H3 Superset → H4 Exercises (standard parent+1)

### Parse Result Structure

```typescript
interface ParseResult {
  success: boolean;
  workout?: WorkoutTemplate;
  errors: ParseError[];
  warnings: ParseWarning[];
}

interface ParseError {
  line: number;
  message: string;
  code: string;
}

interface ParseWarning {
  line: number;
  message: string;
  code: string;
}
```

## LLM Prompt Template

When asking an LLM to generate a workout, use this template:

```
Create a workout in LiftMark Workout Format (LMWF) for [describe workout goal/type].

Format requirements:
- Start with workout name as a header: # [Workout Name]
- Add @tags if relevant
- Add @units: lbs or @units: kg to set default weight units (optional)
- Freeform notes go after the header
- Each exercise is one header level below: ## [Exercise Name]
- Exercise notes are freeform text after exercise header
- Sets format: - [weight] [unit] x [reps] or - [weight] [unit] for [time]
- If @units is set, weight units can be omitted: - [weight] x [reps]
- Functional modifiers: @rest (triggers timer), @dropset (UI behavior), @perside (per-side timer)
- Descriptive data (tempo, RPE, etc.) goes in freeform notes
- For supersets, use nested headers with "superset" in the name
  - Header containing "superset" (case-insensitive) becomes the superset parent
  - Child exercises can be at any deeper header level (not limited to parent+1)
  - Example: ## Superset: Arms, then ### Exercise1, ### Exercise2
  - Also valid: ## Superset: Arms, then #### Exercise1, #### Exercise2
- AMRAP implies to failure (no need for separate failure flag)

Example:
# Push Day
@tags: strength, push
@units: lbs

Feeling good today, going for PRs.

## Bench Press

Focus on bar path and leg drive.
Last set felt like an 8/10 effort.

- 135 x 5 @rest: 120s
- 185 x 5 @rest: 180s
- 225 x 5

## Plank

- **Simplified to one workout per file** - removed multi-workout support for cleaner mental model

- Deprecated `@rpe` and `@tempo` — still parsed for compatibility, but freeform notes are preferred
- Clarified time units in set format components
- Updated examples to use freeform notes for descriptive data
- Simplified header detection logic (first header with exercises = workout)

### Version 1.0 (2026-01-03)

## Design Decisions Made

Based on user feedback, the following design decisions were implemented:

1. ✅ **Freeform Notes**: Notes are now freeform text after headers, not `@notes:` metadata
2. ✅ **Optional Type**: `@type` is completely optional for exercises
3. ✅ **Time-based with Weight**: Supports `45 lbs x 60s` and `45 lbs for 60s` for weighted holds
4. ✅ **Flexible Headers**: Workouts can be any header level (H1-H6), exercises one level below
5. ✅ **No Date Required**: Date removed - import date and workout date are handled separately
6. ✅ **Name = Header**: Header text is the name, no prefix needed
7. ✅ **Superset Support**: Uses nested headers (e.g., `## Superset: Arms` with `### Exercise` children)
8. ✅ **Simplified Modifiers**:
   - Only functional modifiers: `@rest` (triggers timer), `@dropset` (changes UI), `@perside` (per-side timer)
   - Deprecated `@rpe` and `@tempo` — still parsed for compatibility, but freeform notes are preferred
   - `@dropset` and `@perside` are flags, not `@dropset: true`
   - AMRAP implies failure, no separate flag needed
