# Run Workout Flow

## Preconditions

- At least one workout plan exists in the database.

## Flow Steps

1. User taps a workout card on the Home screen, navigating to the workout detail screen.
2. User taps the **Start Workout** button.
3. `sessionStore.startWorkout(plan)` creates a new session from the plan via `createSessionFromPlan()`.
4. The system cancels any existing in-progress sessions before creating the new one. This ensures orphaned or stale sessions (from paused/interrupted workouts) never persist as false resume candidates.
5. **Navigation to Active Workout**: The app MUST navigate to the active workout screen (`/workout/active`). This is a critical navigation transition — the user must see the active workout UI after tapping "Start Workout". If the session is created but the screen does not change, the workout is effectively unusable.
6. The active workout screen is displayed showing:
   - Current exercise name.
   - Set information with **weight AND reps** (e.g., "135 lbs x 5"). Weight must not be omitted.
   - Progress indicator across all exercises and sets.
6. User works through sets using the following actions:
   - **completeSet()**: Saves actual values from the input fields for the set, marks it as completed, and auto-advances to the next set. As exercises are completed, they collapse to a compact summary. The active exercise remains expanded. Users can tap to expand collapsed exercises.
   - **skipSet()**: Marks the set as skipped and auto-advances to the next set.
7. Navigation between sets and exercises:
   - `goToNextSet()` / `goToPreviousSet()` for sequential navigation.
   - `goToExercise()` for jumping to a specific exercise.
8. **Rest timer**: `startRestTimer()` begins after set completion, counts down to zero, and auto-stops. If a rest timer is running when the user completes the next set, the timer is dismissed. If the newly completed set has rest seconds defined, a new rest timer starts for that set's rest duration.
9. **Exercise timer**: For time-based sets, tracks elapsed time versus target duration. When completing a timed set, if the exercise timer was started, the elapsed time is recorded as `actualTime`. If the exercise timer was not started, `targetTime` is used as the default `actualTime`.
10. User taps the **Finish** button to end the workout.
    - If incomplete sets remain, a "Finish Anyway" confirmation dialog is shown.
    - If the majority of sets were skipped (>50% skipped out of total), the Finish flow shows a "Discard Workout?" dialog with options: "Discard" (destructive, cancels session without logging), "Log Anyway" (completes normally), "Cancel" (returns to workout).
11. `completeWorkout()` executes:
    - The active session is captured **before** calling `completeSession()` so it can be passed to the summary screen.
    - Saves `endTime`, `duration`, and sets `status='completed'`.
    - Saves the workout to HealthKit if the integration is enabled.
    - Ends the Live Activity notification.
12. The summary screen receives the completed session directly (not via array lookup) and displays workout stats. User taps **Done** to return to the Home screen.

## State Management

The `SessionStore` (@Observable) tracks:

- `activeSession`: The current workout session object.
- `currentExerciseIndex`: Index of the active exercise.
- `currentSetIndex`: Index of the active set within the current exercise.
- `restTimer`: Countdown state for rest periods.
- `exerciseTimer`: Elapsed time state for time-based sets.

## Session Lifecycle

```
in_progress → completed
in_progress → canceled
```

## Set Actions During Workout

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `completeDropSet()` | Complete a drop set with multiple weight/reps entries at different groupIndices |
| `updateSetValues()` | Edit weight/reps for a set before completing it |
| `addSetToExercise()` | Add extra sets to the current exercise |
| `deleteSetFromExercise()` | Remove a set from the current exercise |
| `updateSetTarget()` | Change target weight/reps values |
| `updateExercise()` | Change exercise name, equipment, or notes |
| `addExercise()` | Add a new exercise to the active workout |

## Variations

- **Drop sets**: Sets with `isDropset == true` show a "+ Drop" button below the primary weight/reps inputs. Tapping "+ Drop" adds a new entry row with weight and reps fields, pre-filling weight from the previous entry. Multiple drops can be added before completing. "Complete Set" records all entries at different `groupIndex` values (0 for primary, 1+ for drops) via `completeDropSet()`. Each drop entry has a delete button (minus icon). Completed drop sets display compactly as "225x10 -> 185x6 -> 135x4" with a "Drop" badge. Drop sets with no added drops behave identically to normal sets.
- **Time-based sets**: The exercise timer tracks elapsed time against a target rather than counting reps. On completion, `actualTime` is set to the timer's elapsed seconds if started, or `targetTime` if not started.
- **All sets completed**: The Finish button proceeds without confirmation.
- **Partially completed workout**: The "Finish Anyway" confirmation is shown listing incomplete sets.
- **Majority skipped workout**: If >50% of sets are skipped, a "Discard Workout?" dialog offers to cancel without logging.
- **Cancel workout**: The session status is set to `canceled` instead of `completed`.
- **Adding exercises mid-workout**: New exercises are appended to the session via `addExercise()`.
- **Exercise collapse**: Completed exercises automatically collapse to a compact summary; users can tap to expand.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Stale in-progress sessions exist | Automatically canceled before starting a new workout |
| Database save failure on set completion | Error surfaced to user |
| HealthKit save failure | Workout still completes; HealthKit error is logged but does not block |
| Live Activity end failure | Workout still completes; error is logged |
| Orphaned Live Activities from crash | Cleaned up on next `startWorkoutLiveActivity()` call |
| CloudKit sync during active workout | Sync skips delete/merge for active session records; other data syncs normally |
| CloudKit sync after workout discarded | Remote `in_progress` status never overwrites a local `canceled` status — user's discard action is authoritative |
| App crash during workout | Session restored from DB on next launch with all exercises and set progress intact |

## Postconditions

- The completed session is stored in the SQLite database with all set data.
- The session is visible in the History tab.
- If HealthKit integration is enabled, the workout is saved to Apple Health.
- The Live Activity notification is ended.
- The `activeSession` in `sessionStore` is cleared.
