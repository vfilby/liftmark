# Workout Detail Screen

## Purpose
Display full details of a workout plan template — exercises, sets, tags, metadata — with actions to start the workout, reprocess from markdown, and toggle favorite.

## Route
`/workout/[id]` — Dynamic route. Accessed by tapping a plan card from Home or Workouts screens.

## Layout
- **Header**: Native stack header with plan name as title, share button (share icon) in headerRight
- **Body**: WorkoutDetailView component (ScrollView) containing:
  1. **Header card**: Plan name, favorite button, description, tags, meta stats (exercises count, total sets, units), Edit and Reprocess buttons
  2. **Exercises section**: Grouped by sections (warmup/cooldown/default) with exercise cards showing set details
- **Footer**: Fixed "Start Workout" button pinned to the bottom of the screen, outside the ScrollView

**Critical**: The "Start Workout" button must be **always visible without scrolling**. It must be positioned as a fixed/sticky element pinned to the bottom of the screen, outside the ScrollView content area. The button must not require the user to scroll past all exercises to reach it. This is essential for long workout plans with many exercises.

## UI Elements

| Element | testID | Type |
|---------|--------|------|
| Loading state | `workout-detail-loading` | View |
| Detail view container | `workout-detail-view` | ScrollView |
| Share button (header) | `share-plan-button` | TouchableOpacity |
| Favorite button | `favorite-button-detail` | TouchableOpacity |
| Start Workout button | `start-workout-button` | TouchableOpacity |
| Exercise card (single) | `exercise-{exercise.id}` | View |
| Superset card | `superset-{globalIndex}` | View |
| Set row | `set-{set.id}` | View |
| YouTube link | `youtube-link-{exerciseName}` | Link |
| Edit markdown button | `edit-plan-markdown-button` | Button |
| Reprocess button | `reprocess-plan-button` | Button |
| Exercise edit button | `edit-plan-exercise-{exerciseId}` | Button |

## User Interactions
- **Tap share button (header)** → exports plan's original markdown (`sourceMarkdown`) as `.md` file via `exportPlanAsMarkdown` → share sheet
- **Tap favorite heart** → toggles favorite, reloads plan
- **Tap "Start Workout"** → checks for active session → starts workout → navigates to `/workout/active`
  - If active session exists: alert with "Resume Workout" option
  - **Critical**: After tapping "Start Workout", the app MUST navigate to the Active Workout screen (`/workout/active`) and display the workout exercises with their sets. The active workout screen must be fully functional — showing exercise names, set targets (weight, reps, time), and input controls. If the session is created but navigation fails or the active workout screen does not appear, this is a blocking bug.
- **Tap "Edit"** → opens Edit Plan Markdown sheet pre-populated with `sourceMarkdown`. User can edit the markdown text with real-time parse validation (same as import flow). Save updates `sourceMarkdown` and reprocesses the plan. Cancel discards changes.
- **Tap "Reprocess"** → confirmation alert → re-parses plan from original `sourceMarkdown` (no editing)
- **Tap pencil icon on exercise card** → opens Edit Exercise sheet (same Form/Markdown dual-tab sheet as active workout) pre-populated with the exercise's data. Save updates the exercise within the plan. Changes are persisted to the plan's `sourceMarkdown` by regenerating it.
- **Tap YouTube icon** on exercise name → opens YouTube search for that exercise

## Navigation
- `/workout/active` — after starting workout or resuming existing
- Back (via router.back()) — on error

## Error/Empty States
- **Plan not loaded**: LoadingView
- **Load error**: Alert with error message, navigates back on dismiss
- **Export failure**: Alert if `sourceMarkdown` is not available (e.g., plan was not imported from markdown)

## WorkoutDetailView Component Details

### Header
- Plan name (large, bold)
- Favorite toggle (heart icon, red when favorited)
- Optional description text
- Tags as pill badges
- Meta stats row: Exercises count, Total Sets, Units (if set)

### Edit / Reprocess Buttons
- Displayed only when `sourceMarkdown != nil`
- Two half-width buttons side by side in an HStack:
  - **Edit** (`edit-plan-markdown-button`): Opens Edit Plan Markdown sheet
  - **Reprocess** (`reprocess-plan-button`): Shows confirmation alert, then reprocesses from stored markdown
- Both buttons use secondary styling (same as the previous single Reprocess button)

### Exercise Cards
- Numbered with section-colored index
- Exercise name with pencil edit icon (`edit-plan-exercise-{exerciseId}`) and YouTube search link
- Equipment type (if set)
- Notes (italic, if present)
- Sets listed with all applicable fields:

#### Set Display Format

Each set row MUST display all data that was parsed from the workout plan. The following fields must be shown when they have values:

| Field | Display Format | Example | Required |
|-------|---------------|---------|----------|
| Set number | Numeric index | "Set 1", "Set 2" | Always |
| Weight | Numeric value + unit | "135 lbs", "60 kg" | When `targetWeight` is set |
| Reps | "x" + count | "x 5", "x 12" | When `targetReps` is set |
| Time | Duration format | "60s", "1:30" | When `targetTime` is set |
| RPE | "@RPE" + value | "@RPE 8" | When `targetRpe` is set |
| Rest | Rest duration | "90s rest" | When `restSeconds` is set |
| Tempo | Tempo notation | "3-0-1-0" | When `tempo` is set |
| Drop set | Badge | "Drop" | When `isDropset` is true |
| Per side | Badge | "/side" | When `isPerSide` is true |

**Critical**: Weight MUST be displayed when it exists in the parsed data. A set row showing only "x 5" when the plan specifies "135 x 5" is a bug — it must show "135 lbs x 5" (or the appropriate unit). The weight is the most important piece of information in a strength training set and must never be silently omitted.

### Section Headers
- Styled divider lines with section name
- Color-coded: warmup (sectionWarmup), cooldown (sectionCooldown), default (primary)

### Supersets
- Purple "SUPERSET" badge
- Multiple exercise names joined with "&"
- Interleaved set display across exercises
