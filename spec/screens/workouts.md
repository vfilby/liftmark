## Workout Detail View

Displayed when a plan card is tapped (phone: push navigation, tablet: right pane of split view).

### Layout
- **Header card**: Plan name, favorite toggle, description, tags
- **Stats grid**: Exercise count, set count, weight units
- **Reprocess button**: Shown if plan has `sourceMarkdown`
- **Exercise list**: Cards for each exercise or superset group

### Exercise Display Rules

Exercises are grouped by section (`groupType == .section`), then within each section:

- **Regular exercises**: Rendered as individual cards with numbered index, exercise name, equipment, notes, and set list
- **Superset groups**: A superset parent (`groupType == .superset`, empty sets) and its children (`parentExerciseId` pointing to parent) are rendered as a **single combined card**:
  - Card header shows a "SUPERSET" badge and the parent exercise name (e.g., "Superset: Triceps")
  - Sets are displayed **interleaved round-robin** across children: child A set 1, child B set 1, child A set 2, child B set 2, etc. Each set row is prefixed with the exercise name to identify which exercise it belongs to.
  - The superset parent exercise is NOT rendered as a separate standalone card
  - Children of a superset are NOT rendered as separate standalone cards
- **Exercise numbering**: Superset parents are excluded from the numbered index. Only exercises with sets (regular exercises and superset children) receive a number.
