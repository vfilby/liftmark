# Crash & Error Reporter Specification (Sentry)

## Purpose

Ship crash reports and non-fatal sync-error signals off-device so regressions are caught without waiting for a user to export logs. `Logger` remains the authoritative on-device record; Sentry is a lossy, privacy-filtered mirror of a narrow subset.

This service exists because a month of failed CloudKit uploads (CKError 12 `invalidArguments`) went unnoticed until a user manually exported debug logs. Visibility is the single justification — any design decision should be evaluated against "does this tell us sooner?".

## Public API

`CrashReporter` is a singleton. All methods are safe to call before `start()` (they no-op) and when the DSN is unconfigured (they no-op).

### `start()`

Initializes the underlying Sentry SDK. Idempotent. Called once from `LiftMarkApp.init`.

If the DSN is missing or empty, `start()` logs at `info` level to `Logger` (`category: .sync`) and returns. The app must never crash because the reporter is unconfigured.

### `captureError(_ error: Error, category: LogCategory, metadata: [String: String]? = nil)`

Report a non-fatal sync-class error. Only whitelisted metadata keys are forwarded (see **Privacy**).

### `captureParseError(_ error: Error, structural: [String: String], rawContent: String? = nil)`

Report a parse-class error. `structural` is always sent; `rawContent` is only attached if the user has enabled `privacy.includeContentInErrorReports`. The reporter — not the caller — checks the setting, so callers always pass the content and the gate is enforced in one place.

### `addBreadcrumb(_ message: String, category: LogCategory, metadata: [String: String]? = nil)`

Leave a trail. Used at sync cycle boundaries.

### `setUserContext(anonymousId: String)`

Attach a stable anonymous identifier so errors from the same device can be grouped. **Never** pass iCloud user IDs, emails, or anything user-provided.

## Initialization

- Called from `LiftMarkApp.init`, guarded to skip during `XCTestCase` runs (matches the existing `CKSyncEngineManager.shared.start()` gate).
- DSN is read from the build-generated `SentryConfig.dsn` constant. The constant is written by a pre-build phase that reads `SENTRY_DSN_REST` from the xcconfig and prepends `https://`. The DSN is split this way because xcconfig treats `//` as a comment start and truncates values containing it — storing the scheme-less suffix and reassembling in shell side-steps the issue.
  - xcconfig file: `mobile-apps/ios/Config/Sentry.xcconfig` — gitignored. Contains `SENTRY_DSN_REST = <dsn-without-https://>`.
  - `Sentry.xcconfig.example` (committed) documents the format.
  - `SentryConfig.swift` is committed with an empty placeholder and overwritten at build time (same pattern as `BuildInfo.swift`).
  - CI (the TestFlight workflow) strips the `https://` prefix from the `SENTRY_DSN` secret and writes the xcconfig before `xcodegen generate`.
- Debug and Release both send to the same Sentry project, tagged by `environment` (`debug`, `testflight`, `release`) derived from `#if DEBUG` + `Bundle.appStoreReceiptURL` path heuristic.
- Release health and auto-session tracking: **enabled**.
- Performance monitoring (`tracesSampleRate`): **0.1** for sync operations only, via explicit transactions — not global auto-instrumentation.

## Privacy

Error sources split into three classes with different rules:

### Sync-class errors
CloudKit errors, DB errors, state persistence errors. The diagnostic signal is structural (error code, record type, field name) — content is not needed to act on the report.

**Never send for sync-class errors:**
- Workout content (exercise names, sets, reps, weights, notes, tags)
- User-provided text of any kind (workout plan titles, settings strings)
- File contents, imported LMWF bodies
- iCloud user identifiers, email, device name
- GPS/location, HealthKit data

### Parse-class errors
LMWF parser, file import, validator failures. The input IS the bug — a report without some form of input is low-signal. These default to **structural-only** and can be escalated to **full content** by an explicit user setting.

**Structural-only** (default — always safe to send):
- Token type and position (line, column)
- Parser state / expected vs. got
- Line count, byte count of the input
- No raw strings, no quoted literals, no identifiers from user input

**Full content** (opt-in via Settings → Privacy → "Include workout content in error reports", default **off**):
- Raw LMWF/markdown body up to 16 KB (truncated with a marker if longer)
- Still no iCloud identifiers, email, or HealthKit data — the toggle only unlocks the workout body itself

The toggle's label in Settings must explicitly say the content leaves the device and name Sentry as the recipient. The setting key is `privacy.includeContentInErrorReports` in `UserSettings`.

### Global always-never
Regardless of class or setting:
- iCloud user identifiers, email, device name
- GPS/location, HealthKit data
- Internal/debug URLs and tokens

### Master off switch
Users can disable crash reporting entirely via Settings → Privacy → "Send crash and error reports". Default **on** (opt-out). Stored in `UserDefaults` key `privacy.crashReportingEnabled`.

When toggled off mid-session, `CrashReporter.setEnabled(false)` calls `SentrySDK.close()`; any subsequent `captureError`/`addBreadcrumb` calls are no-ops until re-enabled. The content-inclusion toggle is nested under and disabled when the master is off.

**Allowed metadata keys** for sync-class errors (enforced by a static allowlist in `CrashReporter`):
- `recordType` — CloudKit record type name (e.g. `WorkoutPlan`, `SessionSet`)
- `errorCode` — integer CKError code
- `errorDomain` — error domain string
- `zoneName` — CloudKit zone name (e.g. `LiftMarkData`)
- `fieldName` — CloudKit field name implicated in `invalidArguments`
- `fkTable` — FK target table for merge errors (e.g. `session_sets`)
- `partialFailureCount` — integer
- `sdkVersion`, `osVersion`, `buildType` — already on every event via Sentry defaults

Record IDs (UUIDs) are allowed in breadcrumbs but **not** in captured error metadata, because Sentry's search makes high-cardinality UUIDs noisy without being useful.

Any key not on the allowlist is dropped silently. The allowlist is a compile-time `Set<String>` constant.

### Migrator-class errors

Events emitted by the one-time GRDB migration bridge and post-bridge schema migrations. Structural only — no user data is ever attached.

**Allowed metadata keys** (enforced by a separate compile-time `migratorMetadataAllowlist` in `CrashReporter` — without it, `beforeSend` sanitizes these away):

- `fromVersion` — starting `schema_version.version` (Int as String)
- `toIdentifier` — highest bridge identifier written (e.g. `v13_default_timer_countdown`)
- `bridgedIdentifierCount` — Int as String
- `durationMs` — Int as String
- `backupPath` — file path only, never content
- `backupSizeBytes`, `dbSizeBytes`, `freeBytes` — Int as String
- `verificationStep` — one of `integrity`, `header`, `tables`, `rowCount`
- `failedIdentifier` — String
- `fkTable` — String (shared with sync-class allowlist)
- `errorDomain`, `errorCode` — shared with sync-class allowlist
- `integrityCheckOutput` — truncated to 2 KB; SQLite's `integrity_check` emits structural messages only
- `resumeReason` — for the app-killed-mid-bridge breadcrumb

The full event catalog and breadcrumb list lives in [`migrator.md`](migrator.md) §5.2 (single source of truth); do not duplicate it here.

### Tags

Tags attached to captured events:

| Tag | Values | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `tag: "data_loss"` | set on `SyncSessionGuard` data-loss-detected / restore-failed paths, and on `migrator_bridge_restore_failed` | Target for a single alert rule |
| `data_integrity_risk` | `"true"` on every migrator failure event except `skipped_already_done`, `skipped_fresh_install`, `build_number_changed` | Target for a single migrator-failure alert rule. See [`migrator.md`](migrator.md) §5.4. |

### `beforeSend` hook

`CrashReporter.start()` installs a `beforeSend` hook that:
1. Drops the event if its `message` or `exception.value` contains any substring from a redaction list (workout plan titles observed from `WorkoutPlanStore`, user display name). This is a defense-in-depth check — the primary defense is not attaching this data in the first place.
2. Strips any `extra` / `tags` keys not on the allowlist.

## Sync instrumentation

### Breadcrumbs
- `CKSyncEngineManager.fetchChanges()` → breadcrumb `sync.fetch.begin`
- `didFetchChanges` delegate → breadcrumb `sync.fetch.end` with `changedRecordTypes` joined string
- `willSendChanges` / `didSendChanges` analogous

### Capture sites

All 28 error sites enumerated in the exploratory survey (see commit message) call `CrashReporter.captureError` **in addition to** their existing `Logger.shared.error(.sync, …)` calls. The Logger call is the on-device source of truth; the Sentry call is best-effort.

High-priority sites (must capture):
- `CKSyncConflictResolver` — all CKError branches
- `CKSyncEngineManager` zone creation, state persistence, state load
- `SyncSessionGuard` data-loss-detected and restore-failed paths — these carry a distinguishing `tag: "data_loss"` so they can be alerted on in Sentry

Low-priority sites (breadcrumb only, no capture):
- Transient `.networkFailure` / `.networkUnavailable` — CKSyncEngine will retry; capturing creates noise

## Dependencies

- `sentry-cocoa` via SPM, pinned to a `from:` version in `project.yml` → `packages:`.
- No Sentry imports outside of `CrashReporter.swift`. The rest of the app talks to our wrapper.

## Tests

Unit tests in `LiftMarkTests/CrashReporterTests.swift`:

1. `start()` with nil DSN does not crash and subsequent calls no-op.
2. `captureError` with metadata containing non-allowlisted keys drops those keys (verified via a testable metadata-filter helper that is not gated on SentrySDK).
3. The metadata-filter helper is `internal` and pure — it can be unit tested without initializing Sentry.
4. `start()` is idempotent — second call is a no-op.
5. `captureParseError` with the opt-in setting **off** does not forward `rawContent` to the SDK (verified via an injected test-seam that records what the wrapper would have sent).
6. `captureParseError` with the opt-in setting **on** forwards `rawContent` truncated to 16 KB with a `…[truncated]` marker.

Manual verification (documented, not automated):
1. Build against a test Sentry project.
2. Trigger a non-fatal via a debug-menu action that calls `CrashReporter.captureError(NSError(domain: "test", code: 1), category: .sync)`.
3. Confirm the event appears in Sentry within ~30 seconds with `environment: debug` and no workout data in the payload.
4. Force a real CKError by signing out of iCloud mid-sync; confirm a `sync.fetch.*` breadcrumb trail and a `CKError` captured event.

## Cost & quotas

Sentry free tier: 5K errors/month. Alpha user base is <50, so we're nowhere near the ceiling. If we approach it, the first lever is tightening the `tracesSampleRate` to 0 and the second is dropping breadcrumbs for low-signal sites. No billing automation in scope for this change.
