description: Generate a strength training workout plan in LMWF (LiftMark Workout Format). Use when the user asks to write, generate, draft, or plan a workout, training day, training plan, lifting session, program, or asks for something "in LMWF" / "in LiftMark format". Produces valid LMWF markdown, validates it via the live API, and iterates on any errors before returning.

# Generate a workout in LMWF

LMWF is a markdown-based format for strength training **plans** (not session records). Full spec: https://workoutformat.liftmark.app/spec.md — fetch it if you need detail beyond what's below.

## Critical semantic: plans, not records

LMWF documents describe what the athlete **intends to do**. Notes express programming intent, technique cues, stop conditions, and targets. **Never** write retrospective content like "felt strong today", "bar path was clean", "last set was a grinder". That is session-log semantics and belongs in the app's session data, not in LMWF.

## Format essentials

```
# Workout Name
@tags: strength, push        # optional, comma-separated
@units: lbs                  # or kg; optional, default is lbs

Workout-level programming note — focus, constraints, stop conditions.

## Exercise Name
Exercise-level note — target ranges, cues, substitutions.

- 135 x 5                    # weight x reps
- 185 x 5 @rest: 180s        # functional modifier: @rest
- 225 x 5 @rest: 180s Aim for RPE 7   # trailing text is a per-set freeform note
- x 10                       # bodyweight (no weight)
- 60s                        # time-based (seconds)
- 2m                         # time-based (minutes)
- 1m 30s                     # time-based (mixed)
```

### Supersets (nested headers, one level deeper)

```
## Arms Superset

### Cable Triceps Pushdown
- 50 x 12
- 50 x 12

### Dumbbell Curl
- 30 x 10
- 30 x 10
```

### Modifiers

- **Functional (use when needed):** `@rest: <duration>`, `@dropset`, `@perside`, `@amrap`. These trigger app behavior (timers, drop-set recording, etc.).
- **Deprecated (do not use — validator emits a warning):** `@rpe`, `@tempo`. Express RPE, tempo, and all descriptive targets as trailing freeform text on the set line (e.g. `- 225 x 5 @rest: 180s Aim for RPE 8, controlled eccentric`).

## Workflow

1. **Generate.** Write the LMWF document based on the user's ask. Default to `@units: lbs` unless the user says kg. Include warmup and cooldown blocks for full sessions; skip them for quick single-exercise drafts. Add programming notes where useful — don't pad.

2. **Validate.** Run the bundled validator:

   ```bash
   ~/.claude/skills/generate-workout/validate.sh <<'EOF'
   # your LMWF here
   EOF
   ```

   or against a file:

   ```bash
   ~/.claude/skills/generate-workout/validate.sh path/to/workout.md
   ```

   The response is JSON with `success`, `summary`, `errors`, `warnings`. If `success: true` and `errors: []`, you're done — if there are warnings, show them to the user but do not block.

3. **Fix and re-validate** on any errors. Common fixes:
   - Bad set format (e.g. using `@rpe` — replace with trailing note).
   - Missing workout H1.
   - Orphan set before first exercise header.
   - Mixed unit suffix in same workout with a different `@units` metadata.

4. **Return** the validated LMWF to the user in a single fenced code block. Do not include the validator's JSON unless asked — the user wants the workout, not the diagnostics.
